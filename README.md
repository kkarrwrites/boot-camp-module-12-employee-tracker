# Boot Camp - Module 12 Challenge - SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker

## About

A Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL coding challenege for Full Stack Coding Boot Camp.

## Description

This is a command line interface (CLI) application written in JavaScript and built using Node.js and npm (specifically the Inquirer, MySQL2, console.table, and dotenv packages). This CLI application asks a user a series of questions through CLI prompts and then adds the user's answers to a SQL database.

## Issues

In the "Add Employee" route, when asked, "Who is the employee's manager?" there is currently no route for a case in which an employee doesn't have a manager.

Also, there is a lot of repetitive code that could likely benefit from refactoring.
